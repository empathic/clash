    Test that `clash policy list` and `clash policy explain`
    produce useful output for inspecting the active policy.

clash:
  policy_sexpr: |
    (default deny "main")
    (policy "main"
      (allow (exec "git" *))
      (deny (exec "git" "push" *)))

steps:
  # List the active policy
  - name: list shows rules
    command: policy list
