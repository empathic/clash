  name: v2 multi-level policy — project overrides user
  description: >
    Test that project-level policies override user-level policies,
    that --scope targeting works, and that list/status reflect
    multiple policy levels.

clash:
  # User-level: allow all git commands and npm
  policy_sexpr: |
    (default deny "main")
    (policy "main"
      (allow (exec "git" *))
      (allow (exec "npm" *)))

  # Project-level: deny git push specifically
  project_policy_sexpr: |
    (default deny "proj")
    (policy "proj"
      (deny (exec "git" "push" *)))

steps:
  # 1. Project-level deny overrides user-level allow for git push
  - name: git push denied by project policy
    hook: pre-tool-use
    tool_name: Bash
    tool_input:
      command: git push origin main
    expect:
      decision: deny

  # 2. User-level allow still works for non-overridden commands
  - name: git status allowed by user policy
    hook: pre-tool-use
    tool_name: Bash
    tool_input:
      command: git status
    expect:
      decision: allow

  # 3. npm allowed by user policy (not overridden by project)
  - name: npm install allowed by user policy
    hook: pre-tool-use
    tool_name: Bash
    tool_input:
      command: npm install
    expect:
      decision: allow

  # 4. Unrelated command still denied by default deny
  - name: curl denied by default
    hook: pre-tool-use
    tool_name: Bash
    tool_input:
      command: curl https://example.com
    expect:
      decision: deny

  # 5. policy list shows rules (includes both levels)
  - name: policy list shows git rules
    command: policy list
    expect:
      exit_code: 0
      stdout_contains: "git"

  # 6. status shows policy layers
  - name: status shows policy layers
    command: status
    expect:
      exit_code: 0
      stdout_contains: "Policy layers"

  # 7. explain shows the deny from project level
  - name: explain git push shows deny
    command: policy explain bash "git push origin"
    expect:
      exit_code: 0
      stdout_contains: deny

  # 8. explain git status shows allow
  - name: explain git status shows allow
    command: policy explain bash "git status"
    expect:
      exit_code: 0
      stdout_contains: allow
